# Cooking

The list of recipes I like to cook.
Recipes are written in [cooklang](https://cooklang.org/), a recipe markup language.
You can read the text file directly, use the [official CLI](https://github.com/cooklang/CookCLI), or the [community CLI](https://github.com/Zheoni/cooklang-chef).
I personnaly use `chef`, the community CLI, with their web interface that I self-host.

# Nix users

The community CLI is packaged in this flake, `nix build` and you'll have the `chef` cli available!
The official CLI is available in a devshell.
